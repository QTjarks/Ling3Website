                        language methodology and make a summary of at least 5 theories which 12 to 16 year old
                        students need to be able to understand.

                    <p>
                        Theory one: the grammar translating method<br>
                        <br>
                        The first theory on how language was taught has to do with direct translation.
                        In the west at the 17th, 18th and 19th century languages like Latin and Greek were
                        considered to be foreign languages. These languages were taught mostly for the people
                        speaking them to sound more intellectual. Within these languages, grammatical rules were of
                        significant importance together with things like memorization of vocabulary and translating
                        texts. Back then, there was no real need to be taught to speak the language, the only real
                        purpose being to sound scholarly. In the late 19th century, the classic method came to be
                        known as the “Grammar translation method”, which still did not offer much else than the
                        grammatical rules when translating a text from a second language to the native one.
                        Even now, this method is still widely and prominently used to teach students a new language
                        and has survived multiple reforms of the teaching methods. In the end, this method only
                        teaches the student to dissect a sentence into different parts to translate it into their
                        native language and will not actually improve a students’ communication skills. (Brown,
                        2002)

                        <hr>
                        Theory two: Audiolingual method<br>
                        <br>
                        This theory has also been named the “army method” as it started in the army without any
                        special programs. During the second world war, the soldiers figured that being able to
                        understand the language their enemies were speaking would give them an advantage in
                        battle, so they set out to teach themselves those languages.
                        The focus of the audiolingual method is not on perfectly understanding words, rather it was
                        focussed on understanding structures and patterns that would show in normal conversations.
                        This way, they could quickly catch onto anything their enemies were saying. This method
                        tries to make sure the pronunciation is correct, and an immediate response can be made. The
                        learning of reading and writing was dependent on how well the person pronounced the language
                        as they did not have any source material to go off of. (UK, 2018)

                        <hr>
                        Theory three: Communicative language learning<br>
                        <br>
                        This method was developed while the revolution was taking place in British teaching
                        methods in the late 1960’s. Before, students were taught a language by hearing a language
                        from their surroundings. This method was developed as a complete opposite of the previously
                        mentioned audiolingual method (which focusses on memorisation). This method focusses on
                        developing the students’ ability by having the students practice in real life situations
                        instead of a textbook, focussing more on meaning than the accuracy and correctness of the
                        sentence. (UK, 2018)
                        <hr>

                        Theory four: Task-based language learning<br>
                        <br>
                        This method shifted the focus from learning directly from a textbook to a more practical
                        approach, a problem solving one. This method is formed from the belief that learners should
                        be given tasks to complete, all the while learning the language. The goal of this method
                        would be to give the students a task to complete while all communication during the solving
                        of that task would have to be in the English language. This way, the students would learn to
                        speak fluently and effectively.
                        (Richards, 2001)
                        <hr>

                        Theory five: Suggestopedia<br>
                        <br>
                        Instead of actively improving or learning the active language, a method was developed to
                        learn languages passively. Lozanov believed that we are able to learn much more than we
                        think. Based on Soviet research he came up with a learning method that used relaxation as a
                        way to pick up new knowledge. Naturally, music was a very important part of this teaching
                        method. The way this method would work is that while the students were relaxed, readings,
                        role-plays and dramas would be played in the background to get the students relaxed enough
                        to be able to pick up this knowledge without having to focus on it.
