                        <p>
                            A particular point in linguistics that interested me was the speed at which languages are
                            spoken. Measuring the speed at which a language is spoken will be impossible to accurately
                            measure as there is no standard that it can be held to. There are multiple factors that
                            might also throw off calculations such as the pauses an individual might take
                            in their sentences and the amount of syllables in the language itself.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Studies for measuring</b><br>
                            In the words of John Layer (A Cambridge researcher) Analyzing the tempo of a language can be dangerously open to subjective bias ... listeners' 
                            judgments rapidly begin to lose objectivity when the utterance concerned comes either from an unfamiliar accent or ..
                            from an unfamiliar language"(Layer, 1994)<small>[1]</small>.<br>

                            
                            Because measuring the language was and still is this difficult, studies are often done using tools specifically built
                            for linguistic analyzing such as Praat[2] to measure the speed of a language.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Because the results of a measurement could be greatly affected by the pauses an individual takes, tests are divided
                            between tests that measure speed tempo <i>with</i> pauses and measurements that do <i>exclude</i> pauses[1]. 
                            The measurements that include pauses are referred to as the <b>speaking rate</b> as it references the amount
                            of words spoken in a more realistic scenario, imagine a corporate meeting or a conversation between people. 
                            The other measurement is referred to as the "articulation rate" as it represents the amount of words an individual
                            can express on average. 
                            These tests have to be undertaken by a larger group of people as both of these measurements depend on both 
                            internal and external factors, a good example of this would be the speed difference between telling a story or conducting
                            an interview(Kowal, 1983)[3]. 

                            Various units of measurements have been tried throughout the years, the unit most used when measurements were starting was
                            <b>Words Per Minute</b> seeing that this measurement was usable for morse code, a method used often before phones became more common. 
                            This unit had drawbacks however, the first problem was that "word" was not defined properly which made measuring for "words" difficult,
                            the other problem was that speech will often not be stable over time and might fluctuate wildly.<br>
                            As an alternative, the <b>syllables per second</b> has been used often in measurements as it has been well-defined. 
                            The problem arises when a phonetic syllable arises, researchers could often not come to an agreement whether 
                            a word had five or four syllables.
                            <br>
                            In a recent development, the unit <b>sounds per second</b> has been proposed.
                            This unit is both well-defined and stable enough to where discussion cannot arise easily.
                            One of the points holding this method back is the potential of confusion as
                            a word needs to be an observable phonetic unit to count, which can be difficult (but not impossible!) to measure.

                            <b>Comparing languages</b><br>
                            In a research paper published by the University of Klagenfurt Austria,
                            the tempo of languages were tested and researched so a basis could be established which would allow researchers to compare
                            the tempo of languages. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The measurement unit was set as "syllables per information unit" as this would allow the researchers to compare speech properly,
                            even when the language tempo normally cannot be isolated. 
                            
                            This research chose to focus on three theories concerning the tempo of language:<br>
                            1. Some languages are simply spoken more rapidly.<br>
                            2. Speech tempo is part of the linguistic structure of languages.<br>
                            3. The difference lies with the individual.<br>

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The method used to come to a conclusion was the "Elements per unit time" to correctly measure any kind of lingual output. 
                            The "Elements per unit time" is used instead of the "syllable method" because the latter would give inconsistent results, this being caused by
                            the fact that words are variable in their size as measured in syllables.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A control group consisting of 51 languages (18 Indo-European, 32 Non-Indo-European) were asked to translate
                            22 cross-linguistically comparable and rhythmically relevant clauses.<br>
                            The clauses, when translated by the control group, enabled the researchers to measure the total amount of used words.
                            In addition, the subjects were instructed to read their translation in normal speech and count the number of syllables.
                            The number of "phonemes" was determined by the first author and grammar of the respective language. 

                            Using a method of exploratory data analysis<small>[5]</small>, the test results indicate that the amount of syllables per
                            declarative sentence is a simple way to measure the overall complexity. Though surprisingly, the amount measured between languages
                            was near negligible with a margin of 0.70. 
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            In conclusion:
                            The "Syllables per information" unit was applied for this research subject to both analyze and compare different languages 
                            while still respecting their tempo. This research also showed that the used measurement unit and other units commonly used to
                            analyze linguistics. <br>
                            As it seems, languages that were originally classified as stress-timed(A language type where the stressed syllables are said at 
                            approximately regular intervals<small>[6]</small>) have a lower tempo overall than a language that is
                            syllable-timed(A language type where syllables take approximately the same amount of time to pronounce<small>[7]</small>).<br>
                            The overall findings indicate that the key to understanding the perceived differences lies in their syllable structure. <br>
                            In other words: <b>A higher tempo does not directly mean faster transmission of information.</b>
