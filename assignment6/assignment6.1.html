                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">The goal for this exercise for me to choose a topic
                        that has to do with Language Awareness and research it, after which i will present my
                        findings.
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A particular point in linguistics that interested me was the speed in which languages are
                            spoken. The speed at which a language is spoken is something near impossible to accurately
                            measure as there is no standard that it can be held to. There are multiple factors within
                            measuring that might also throw off calculations such as the pauses an individual might take
                            in their sentences and the amount of syllables in the language itself.

                            Studies for measuring<br>
                            Because measuring the language was this difficult, studies often used two kinds of methods
                            to measure the speed of a language. One of them was the speaking rate which included pauses
                            and hesitation and the other method without taking pauses into account. Two commonly used
                            terms in this research were speaking rate and articulation rate. Both being heavily
                            corelated with speech tempo. Speaking rate was the rate in which sounds left the mouth of
                            the speaker, which would normally include pauses in speech. The other method, articulation
                            rate, measured the speed at which fully articulated words left the mouth of the speaker to
                            measure it per word, this method does not measure pauses, as it measures the amount of
                            words, nothing between these words. To effectively compare languages, rules were put in
                            place to penalize individuals who talk too quickly and frequently make mistake, these rules
                            would ensure that individuals would not try to speak out of their language’s speed
                            intentionally.

                            Comparing languages<br>
                            When comparing measurements between languages, the scientists encountered another problem,
                            the amount of syllables in a word. For example, if syllables were measured Finnish would be
                            spoken more quickly than English, yet if words were to be measured the English language
                            would come out on top. To make it even more difficult, the measurement method that uses
                            words can be thrown off on basis of how a “word” is defined. In an attempt to accurately
                            measure the speaking speed of a language, the syllables-per-second measurement was created.
                            This method might not be that much more efficient in measuring a language’s speed, it should
                            be kept in mind that different languages have very different syllable structures. Many of
                            the world’s languages do not use syllables with more than two or three sounds, while other
                            languages might allow drastically more sounds per syllable. A language like The Japanese
                            language is able to fit more syllables into a given timeframe than a language with a more
                            complicated language structure, like the language structure of the English language.
